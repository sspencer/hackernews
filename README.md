# HackerNews

Native iOS6 HackerNews RSS reader.  

A fun little project to make downloading hacker news just a little bit faster (by not having to download larger HTML file and separate CSS file).


Uses [RaptureXML](https://github.com/ZaBlanc/RaptureXML) for super easy XML parsing and network fetching.
